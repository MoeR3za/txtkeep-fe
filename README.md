- **public/**: Contains static files like `index.html`.
- **src/**: Contains the main source code for the application.
  - **components/**: Reusable UI components.
  - **pages/**: Different pages of the application.
  - **services/**: API calls and business logic.
- **tests/**: Contains unit and integration tests.

## Running the Project

To run the project locally, use:

```sh
npm start
```

This will start the development server and you can view the project at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

To deploy the project, simply push your changes to the main branch. Vercel will automatically handle the deployment process.

```sh
git push origin main
```

## Architecture

The project follows a component-based architecture using React. This allows for modular, reusable, and maintainable code. The backend services are abstracted into a separate layer to ensure separation of concerns and scalability.

### Why This Architecture?

- **Modularity**: Easier to manage and scale.
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different parts of the application.
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to maintain.

## Testing

The project includes both unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application.

- **Unit Tests**: Located in `tests/unit/`, these tests cover individual components and functions.
- **Integration Tests**: Located in `tests/integration/`, these tests cover the interaction between different parts of the application.

To run the tests, use:

```sh
npm test
```
